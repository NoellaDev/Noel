We are thrilled to announce Noella, your open source AI agent built to automate your tasks.

Powered by your choice of large language models (LLMs), a user-friendly desktop interface and CLI, and extensions that integrate with your existing tools and applications, Noella is designed to enhance your productivity and workflow.

# How Noella Works
Noella operates as an intelligent, autonomous agent capable of handling complex tasks through a well-orchestrated coordination of its core features:

## Using Extensions: 
Extensions are key to Noella adaptability, providing you the ability to connect with applications and tools that you already use. Whether itâ€™s connecting to GitHub, accessing Google Drive or integrating with JetBrains IDEs, the possibilities are extensive. Some of these extensions have been curated in the extensions directory. Noella extensions are built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) - enabling you to build or bring your own custom integrations to Noella.

## LLM Providers: 
Noella is compatible with a wide range of LLM providers, allowing you to choose and integrate your preferred model.

## CLI and Desktop Support: 
You can run Noella as a desktop app or through the command-line interface (CLI) using the same configurations across both.
