# Sharing

When you've had a really useful session using Goose, we recommend saving the session and sharing it with others via:

```bash
sq goose share
```

Once you select a session to share, it will provide you with a Square Console link that anyone can use to visualize how your Goose session played out. This can be especially useful in:

- providing our team with feedback on the shortcomings of Goose
- instructing your teammates on how to better use Goose

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that the link cannot be found on the Square Console page, so if you lose it, you will need to reshare the session, which will generate a new link for you.
