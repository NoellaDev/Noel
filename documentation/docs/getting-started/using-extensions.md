# Using Extensions

Goose Extensions are add-ons that provide are a way to extend the functionality of Goose. They also provide a way to connect Goose with applications and tools you already use in your workflow. These extensions can be used to add new features, automate tasks, or integrate with other systems.

### Adding An Extension
You can expand Goose's capabilities by adding extensions. Built-in extensions are pre-installed with Goose, while external extensions can be integrated via [Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP)][mcp].
