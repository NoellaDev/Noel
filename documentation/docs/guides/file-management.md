# File Management with Goose

As an autonomous agent, goose is designed to carry out tasks following specified instructions - this may sometimes involve working with local files. It's essential to follow best practices for safe file modification to monitor changes and revert any where necessary.

Here are a few tips to help you manage file operations with goose effectively:

## Safe Modification Practices

1. **Version Control**: Always use a version control system (VCS) like Git to track changes to your codebase. This prevents accidental overwriting and allows you to revert back to previous states easily. Ensure you commit changes before running goose on your codebase. Use branches to separate experimental changes from the main codebase.

2. **Validation and Testing**: Implement validation and testing steps before and after goose modifies any files. Run your unit tests to verify changes made by goose. Use a staging environment to ensure changes integrate well with the entire system.

3. **Change Review**: Manually review or use automated code reviews to ensure the quality of generated code or changes. Integrate tools such as diff tools to visualize changes made by goose. Implement a review process with team members or CI/CD pipelines.

4. **Codebase Organization**: Structure your codebase into well-defined modules or subdirectories to manage them efficiently. Use a modular approach to isolate parts of the code goose needs to access. You can also provide specific directories or file paths you want goose to work on.


By following these practices, you can leverage goose effectively while maintaining the integrity and safety of your codebase.
