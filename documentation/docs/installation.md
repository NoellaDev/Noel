curl -fsSL https://github.com/block/goose/releases/download/stable/download_cli.sh | sh
```
This script will fetch the latest version of Goose and set it up on your system.

#### Instaling the Goose UI

To install the Goose desktop UI, follow these steps:

2. Download the `Goose.zip` file.
3. Open the downloaded `Goose.zip` file and launch the desktop application.

### Configuration
Goose allows you to configure settings for both its command-line interface (CLI) and desktop UI. You can update your LLM provider and API key, enable or disable extensions, and add new extensions to enhance Goose's functionality.

#### Set up a provider
Goose works with a set of [supported LLM providers][providers] that you can obtain an API key from if you don't already have one. You'll be prompted to pick a provider and set an API key on your initial install of Goose.

Some providers also have rate limits on API usage, which can affect your experience.
