### Set Up a Provider
Goose works with a set of [supported LLM providers][providers], and you’ll need an API key to get started. When you use Goose for the first time, you’ll be prompted to select a provider and enter your API key.

The process will look similar to the example below:

:::info Billing
You will need to have credits in your LLM Provider account (when necessary) to be able to successfully make requests. Some providers also have rate limits on API usage, which can affect your experience. Check out the [Handling Rate Limits][handling-rate-limits] guide to learn how to efficiently manage these limits while using Goose.
